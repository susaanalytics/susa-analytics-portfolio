# Revenue Stress Testing & Downside Risk Scenarios
Project Overview

This project applies scenario-based stress testing to evaluate revenue resilience under adverse demand and pricing conditions.
The analysis mirrors banking-style risk frameworks, focusing on downside exposure rather than point forecasts.

# Business Problem

Organisations need to understand how revenue behaves under stress to:

anticipate downside risk

support capital and liquidity planning

avoid over-reliance on optimistic base-case assumptions

This project quantifies revenue vulnerability under progressively adverse scenarios.

# Dataset

Historical retail transaction data

Monthly aggregation

Key variables: Revenue, Quantity, Average Price

# Methodology

1. Baseline construction: Monthly revenue aggregation

2- Stress scenario design: Base (no shock), Mild stress, Severe stress, Extreme stress (combined price and volume shocks)

3. Impact assessment: Monthly revenue deviation vs base, Cumulative revenue impact, Worst-case drawdowns

   # Key Insights

Revenue remains relatively resilient under mild stress, but deteriorates rapidly as stress severity increases.

Downside risk is non-linear: losses accelerate faster than gains under adverse conditions.

Under extreme stress, cumulative revenue erosion exceeds £4M–£5M relative to the base scenario.


# Business Recommendations

Introduce early-warning revenue drawdown thresholds to trigger mitigation actions.

Embed stress scenarios into budgeting and forecasting processes.

Apply proactive pricing and demand stabilisation strategies before conditions escalate.

Maintain sufficient capital and liquidity buffers to absorb severe downside shocks.
