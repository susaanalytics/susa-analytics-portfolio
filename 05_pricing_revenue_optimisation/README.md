# Pricing & Revenue Optimisation Analytics  
### Understanding Price, Volume, and Revenue Drivers

# Pricing & Revenue Optimisation Analytics

## Project Overview
Revenue performance is driven by a combination of pricing, sales volume, and customer mix.  
This project analyses historical transaction data to understand how changes in price and quantity influence revenue outcomes and to identify optimisation opportunities.

The focus is on **decision-oriented analytics**, supporting pricing strategy, revenue management, and commercial planning.

## Business Problem
Organisations need to understand:
- How much revenue change is driven by price vs volume
- Which customers and products contribute most to revenue
- Where pricing or volume interventions could improve performance

This type of analysis is critical for banking, finance, and commercial strategy teams.
