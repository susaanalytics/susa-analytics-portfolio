# 📈 Forecasting & Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
Accurate forecasting is critical for planning, budgeting, and strategic decision-making.  
This project applies time series analysis and forecasting techniques to historical sales data to identify trends, seasonality, and future demand patterns.

The focus is on **business-relevant forecasting**, not just statistical accuracy.

---

## Business Problem
Organisations need reliable demand forecasts to:
- anticipate future revenue
- manage inventory and resources
- support financial and strategic planning

This project addresses these needs using interpretable time-series models.

---

## Dataset
- Historical retail sales data (monthly aggregation)
- Time period: multiple years
- Target variable: Monthly revenue

---

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured forecasting pipeline:

1. **Data preparation**
   - Date parsing and aggregation
   - Handling missing values and outliers

2. **Exploratory Time Series Analysis**
   - Trend and seasonality analysis
   - Rolling statistics
   - Time series decomposition

3. **Forecasting Models**
   - Baseline models (naïve / moving average)
   - ARIMA / SARIMA
   - Model evaluation and comparison

---

## Key Insights
- Sales exhibit strong **seasonality** and **long-term trends**
- End-of-year periods show consistently higher demand
- Forecasting models can support proactive business planning

---

## Tools & Skills
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- Time Series Analysis
- Forecasting & Model Evaluation
- Business Insight Communication

---

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — forecasting models and visual outputs are being developed.
